## My process

1. I tried to get the layout first, which was a pain because it's the first time I've done it. Decided to use flexbox
2. Once I got it, then made sure the colors and fonts where correctly done and rendered
3. Then I had to adjust margins, padding and font size. Everything is done in px so it's terribly not responsive
### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make a basic component. It's still terrible, so I'd absolutely love any feedback on how to do it better
